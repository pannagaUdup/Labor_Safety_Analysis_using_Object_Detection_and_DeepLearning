# Labor_Safety_Analysis_using_Object_Detection_and_DeepLearning
The proposed system can identify various types of safety gear and assess their positions and movements to detect potential hazards 
in real-time. A real-time hazard detection mechanism where workers and supervisors are notified through an alert system in case of any
potential hazard. The experimental results confirm the system's ability to enhance workplace safety significantly. 
Key Frame Extraction methods are implemented for effective use of computational resource during continuous surveillance.
